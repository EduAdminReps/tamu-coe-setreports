AEFIS - Assessment, Evaluation, Feedback & Intervention System

This script reads CSV files and generates CSV files in a format suitable for Pandas.
The original reports are generated through AEFIS (https://tamu.aefis.net/) under
"Student Course Evaluation Results by Instructor Report" with appropriate parameters.
Every report is then exported to an AEFIS CSV file with its inconvenient block format.
Any CSV report in the latter format can act as an input to this script for further processing.

AEFIS Parameters:
    Term: Fall 2023 - College Station
    Institution: TAMU [TAMU]
    College: Engineering [EN]
    Department: CS-Unit Engineering [CS-DEPT]
    Instructor Type: Instructor
    Course Section: No Courses for Selected Faculty
    Question Type: Multi-Choice, Single Answer [MCSA], Multi-Choice, Multi Answer [MCMA] and 4 more...
    Question: No Question
    Show Comments: Yes

The emphasis is on the standard AEFIS questions selected by the 2022 College of Engineering
Student Evaluation of Teaching Task Force.
